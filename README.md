# IT4C Design System

**Shared Design System for Utopia and Ocelot**

A unified design system and component library supporting both social platforms (Utopia-Map and Ocelot.social).

**Goal:** Eliminate duplicate work, leverage synergies, and use resources more efficiently, as both projects share the same mission - connecting people for positive social change.

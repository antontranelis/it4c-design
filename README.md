# Unified Ocelot/Utopia Specification

This repository contains the initial specification for merging the existing `ocelot.social` and `Utopia Map` projects. The goal is to define common data models, APIs and design tokens so that both applications can share features and components.

- `spec/data-models.yaml` – core entities in YAML form
- `spec/openapi.yaml` – skeleton API description
- `spec/design/design-tokens.json` – base design tokens

The repository currently only provides the minimal structure. We will extend the specification step by step.

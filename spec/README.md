# Specification

This folder hosts the machine-readable specification that unifies the Ocelot.social feed with the Utopia Map functionality. The documents are intentionally minimal and will evolve.

- `data-models.yaml` describes the shared entities used across both applications.
- `openapi.yaml` contains the starting point for the API surface.
- `design/` stores design tokens and other UI related assets.

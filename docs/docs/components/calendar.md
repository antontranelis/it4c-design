## User Stories

The module was developed based on real needs from the Utopia Community Mapping network –  
formulated as user stories:

📍 “As a organizer, I want to create an appointment directly on the map so that others can see it and participate.”

👁️ “As a user, I want to be able to monitor appointments so that I stay informed, even if I am not (yet) participating.”

✅ “As a participant, I want to be able to register bindingly so that it is clear who is coming.”

📬 “As an admin, I want to be able to link appointments to my Telegram group so that the community is automatically informed.”

🔁 “As an organizer, I want to be able to create recurring appointments to facilitate regular meetings.”

🗓️ “As a user, I want to be able to see my events in my profile and export them to my calendar app so that I don't miss anything.”

📎 “As a user, I want to be able to generate a QR code for my event so that I can share it quickly.”
